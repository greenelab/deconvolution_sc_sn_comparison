# Deconvolution using single-cell RNA sequencing dataset combined with a single-nucleus cell type.

**The following repository is a work in progress.**

The aim is to find a method of normalization or transformation that can be applied to single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset, improving deconvolution.

## The following files are currently in the repository:
### 1. 0_preprocess_data.sh: does the sc and sc preprocessing/QC for all datasets.
### 2. 1_run_prep_all.sh: prepares the files for deconvolution experiment with holding out cells.
