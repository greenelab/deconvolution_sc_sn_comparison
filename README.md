# Deconvolution using single-cell RNA sequencing dataset combined with a single-nucleus cell type.

**The following repository is a work in progress.**

The aim is to find a method of normalization or transformation that can be applied to single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset, improving deconvolution.

## The following files are currently in the repository:
### 1. run_prep_all.sh: Bash script to run the file below (prepare_deconvolution.py)
### 2. prepare_deconvolution.py: Python script to prepare the files for deconvolution.
